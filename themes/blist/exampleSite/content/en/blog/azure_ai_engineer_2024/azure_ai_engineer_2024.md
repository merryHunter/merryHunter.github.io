In May 2024, I gained Azure Fundamentals and Azure AI Engineer certifications. I have been working with Azure for 10 months so far and I spent around 3 days of preparation and scored 854. Here are my tips on how to be more prepared and what you should do during the exam.

## Tip 1: Start from exam readiness zone

Go to read

## Tip 2: Review FAQ sections


## Tip 3: Pay attention to SDK and services JSON responses


## Tip 4: Most important - use Microsoft Learn during exam!

This is something you won't know unless you take the exam, but Microsoft actually lets you use reference documentation during the exam!

 And this comes extremely helpful. It does not mean you will easily find all answers, but it will certainly help you local verify if you are doubtfull about answers and fix mistakes in the end of the class. I recommend using it at the end of the exam for questions you mark "for review", and during case studies (as you cannot revisit them).
