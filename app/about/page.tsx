          Hi, I'm Ivan Chernukha - a passionate technologist and AI enthusiast.
          Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share insights, experiences,
          and discoveries in the world of technology and artificial intelligence.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My fascination with technology started early, and over the years, I've had
          the privilege of working on diverse projects ranging from web development
          to machine learning applications. I believe in the power of AI to transform
          the way we work and live, making processes more efficient and opening up
          new possibilities we haven't even imagined yet.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, I focus on exploring practical applications of AI in various domains.
          Whether it's automating repetitive tasks, building intelligent systems, or
          simply finding ways to make technology more accessible, I'm always excited
          about the next challenge.
